User Authentication: Implement user authentication using Amazon Cognito to 
allow users to sign up, sign in, and manage their accounts securely.
 
Image Upload: Allow users to upload images to the platform. 
Utilize Amazon S3 to store the uploaded images securely. 
You can use JavaScript to handle the frontend logic for selecting and uploading images.
 
Image Gallery: Display the uploaded images in a gallery format on the frontend. 
Use JavaScript to fetch and display images dynamically.

API Gateway: Create RESTful APIs using Amazon API Gateway to expose endpoints for uploading, viewing, and deleting images. 
These APIs will trigger the corresponding Lambda functions.

Database Integration: Use Amazon DynamoDB to store metadata about the uploaded images, 
such as the owner's ID, image URL, timestamp, etc. This will facilitate efficient querying and management of images.

User Permissions: Ensure that users can only view and delete their own images. 
Implement authorization checks in your Lambda functions to enforce these permissions.
